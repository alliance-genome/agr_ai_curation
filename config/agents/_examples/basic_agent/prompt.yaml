# =============================================================================
# AGENT PROMPT: basic_agent
# =============================================================================
# This is the base prompt template for the agent. Customize this for your
# specific use case.
#
# The prompt is injected with:
#   1. This base content
#   2. Group-specific rules (if group_rules_enabled: true in agent.yaml)
#   3. Dynamic context (document info, user context, etc.)
#
# Tips for writing good prompts:
#   - Be specific about what the agent can and cannot do
#   - Define the expected output format clearly
#   - Include examples where helpful
#   - Use markdown formatting for readability
# =============================================================================

# agent_id: Must match agent.yaml and folder name
agent_id: basic_agent

# content: The actual prompt text. Use YAML multiline string (|) for formatting.
