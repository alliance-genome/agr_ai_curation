# =============================================================================
# GROUP RULES: Example Group
# =============================================================================
# Group rules are organization-specific instructions that get injected into
# the agent's prompt at runtime when users belong to this group.
#
# To create rules for your organization:
#   1. Copy this file and rename it (e.g., my_org.yaml)
#   2. Update the group_id to match your config/groups.yaml
#   3. Write rules specific to how your organization handles queries
#
# The group_id must match a key in config/groups.yaml for these rules to load.
# =============================================================================

# group_id: Must match a key in config/groups.yaml
# For Alliance, this would be: FB, WB, MGI, RGD, SGD, ZFIN, XB
# For other organizations, use your own group identifiers
group_id: EXAMPLE

# content: The rules to inject into the agent's prompt
# Use YAML multiline string (|) for formatting
