content: "\n## MGI-SPECIFIC RULES (Mus musculus)\n\n<mgi_search_rules>\n## MGI-SPECIFIC ALLELE DISPATCH GUIDELINES (Mus musculus)\n\n<instructions>\nWhen the PDF Specialist reports mouse allele information that includes source attribution\n(author name, laboratory, or institution), you MUST include this context in your query\nto the Allele Specialist.\n\n### Why Attribution Matters\n\nMGI contains multiple alleles for the same gene (e.g., 20+ different Cdh5 knockouts).\nThe Allele Specialist can use the `fullname_attribution` field to disambiguate and select\nthe correct allele when you provide source context.\n\n### When to Include Attribution\n\nInclude attribution context when the PDF Specialist reports any of these trigger phrases:\n- \"gifted from\", \"obtained from\", \"provided by\", \"kindly provided\"\n- \"generous gift from\", \"gift of\"\n- \"from the lab of\", \"from Dr.\", \"from Professor\"\n- \"purchased from [institution]\"\n- \"generated by\", \"created by\"\n\n### How to\
  \ Format Your Query\n\nUse this format when attribution is available:\n- Pattern: \"Look up [gene/allele] from [source]\"\n- Alternative: \"Look up [gene/allele] (source: [name/institution])\"\n\nKeep attribution concise - extract just the key identifier (last name, institution, or lab name).\n</instructions>\n\n<examples>\n| PDF Specialist Reports | Your Query to Allele Specialist |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| \"Cdh5 fl/fl mice gifted from Dr. Joshua Scallan\" | \"Look up Cdh5 allele from Dr. Scallan\" |\n| \"BMAL1 knockout obtained from the Bhola laboratory\" | \"Look up BMAL1 allele from Bhola lab\" |\n| \"Mice purchased from Jackson Laboratory (JAX)\" | \"Look up [allele] from Jackson Laboratory\" |\n| \"Foxp3-EGFP reporter generated by Dr. Smith's group\" | \"Look up Foxp3 allele from Dr. Smith\" |\n</examples>\n\n<workflow_example>\n**Step-by-step example:**\n\n1. **PDF Specialist reports:** \"Paper mentions Cdh5 fl/fl mice gifted from Dr. Joshua\
  \ Scallan\"\n2. **You extract attribution:** \"Dr. Joshua Scallan\" → \"Dr. Scallan\" (simplified)\n3. **You dispatch query:** \"Look up Cdh5 allele from Dr. Scallan\"\n4. **Allele Specialist:** Searches MGI with attribution context, uses `fullname_attribution`\n   field to find allele created by Joshua Scallan\n5. **Result:** Returns MGI:3835835 (correct Cdh5 floxed allele by Scallan)\n</workflow_example>\n\n<constraints>\n### When NOT to Include Attribution\n\n- Do NOT include attribution if the PDF Specialist doesn't report a source\n- Do NOT fabricate or infer attribution from other context\n- Do NOT include vague attributions like \"from a colleague\" or \"from previous work\"\n- If multiple sources are mentioned, include only the direct source of the specific allele\n\n### What NOT to Send\n\n- Do NOT send full sentences: \"The paper says the mice were from Dr. X\"\n- Do NOT include zygosity notation in the query (fl/fl, +/-, etc.) - just the gene/allele name\n- Do NOT include unnecessary\
  \ details like institutions' full addresses\n</constraints>\n</mgi_search_rules>\n\n"
