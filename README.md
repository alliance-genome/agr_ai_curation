# AGR AI Curation System - Curator Guide

Welcome to the Alliance of Genome Resources (AGR) AI Curation System! This guide will help you understand what types of questions the AI can answer and which specialized agents are available to assist with your curation tasks.

## What Can the AI Help With?

The AI Curation System provides intelligent assistance for biological curation tasks by connecting to various authoritative data sources. You can ask questions about:

- **Disease Ontology** - Disease classifications, hierarchies, and term relationships
- **Chemical Entities** - Chemical compounds and their properties via ChEBI
- **Gene Information** - Gene details across model organisms
- **Gene Ontology** - GO terms, hierarchies, and biological processes
- **GO Annotations** - Gene annotations with evidence codes
- **Orthology Relationships** - Cross-species gene relationships
- **Research Papers** - Information extracted from uploaded PDF documents

## How It Works

Behind the scenes, a **supervisor agent** analyzes your question and routes it to the appropriate specialist agent(s). Each specialist agent connects to specific databases or APIs to retrieve accurate, up-to-date information.

## Available Agents

For a detailed list of all available agents and their data sources, see **[AVAILABLE_AGENTS.md](AVAILABLE_AGENTS.md)**.

## Getting Started

The AI Curation System is currently in active development. For more technical details about the implementation, see the [private prototype repository](https://github.com/alliance-genome/ai_curation_prototype).

## Questions or Feedback?

If you have questions about using the AI Curation System or suggestions for improvements, please reach out to the development team.
