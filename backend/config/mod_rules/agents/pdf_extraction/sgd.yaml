  ## SGD PDF Extraction Strategy (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Yeast papers use uppercase gene symbols (GAL4, TRP1)
  - Deletion strains noted with delta symbol or ::marker notation
  - Look for strain background (BY4741, S288C, W303)

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed
