  ## ZFIN Gene Search Strategy (Danio rerio)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Zebrafish gene symbols are lowercase (e.g., tp53, brca2)
  - Human orthologs use lowercase version of human symbol
  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add zebrafish gene-specific search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting ZFIN Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add zebrafish gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
