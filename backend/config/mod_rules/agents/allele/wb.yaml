  ## WormBase Allele Search Strategy (Caenorhabditis elegans)

  ### General Guidelines

  - C. elegans gene names are typically lowercase and italicized (e.g., unc-4)
  - Allele names follow the pattern: mutation-type + number (e.g., e1315)
  - Search using the allele designation as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  ### Interpreting WormBase Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the allele type matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add worm-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
