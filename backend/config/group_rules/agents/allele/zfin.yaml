  ## ZFIN Allele Search Strategy (Danio rerio)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Zebrafish gene symbols are typically lowercase (e.g., tp53, brca2)
  - Mutant allele names include lab designation codes
  - Search using the symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add zebrafish-specific allele search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting ZFIN Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the allele type matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add zebrafish-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
