  ## HGNC Allele Search Strategy (Homo sapiens)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Human gene symbols are typically uppercase (e.g., TP53, BRCA1)
  - Variant nomenclature follows HGVS guidelines
  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add human-specific allele search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting HGNC Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the variant/allele matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add human-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
