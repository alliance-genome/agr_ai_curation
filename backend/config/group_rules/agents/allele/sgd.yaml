  ## SGD Allele Search Strategy (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Yeast gene names are typically 3-letter codes in uppercase (e.g., GAL4, TRP1)
  - Deletion alleles are denoted with delta symbol or ::marker notation
  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add yeast-specific allele search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting SGD Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the allele type matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add yeast-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
