  ## FlyBase Allele Search Strategy (Drosophila melanogaster)

  ### General Guidelines

  - FlyBase allele symbols typically use superscript notation: gene<sup>allele</sup>
  - Search using the symbol as written in the paper
  - Common allele types include: null, hypomorphic, gain-of-function

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add fly-specific allele search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting FlyBase Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the allele type matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add fly-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
