  ## HGNC Gene Search Strategy (Homo sapiens)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Human gene symbols are typically uppercase (e.g., TP53, BRCA1)
  - Official symbols are defined by HGNC
  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add human gene-specific search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting HGNC Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add human gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
