  ## SGD Gene Search Strategy (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Yeast gene names are typically 3-letter codes in uppercase (e.g., GAL4, TRP1)
  - Standard names may differ from systematic names (YBR155W)
  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add yeast gene-specific search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting SGD Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add yeast gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
