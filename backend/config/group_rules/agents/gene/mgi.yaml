  ## MGI Gene Search Strategy (Mus musculus)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Mouse gene symbols use initial capital letter (e.g., Trp53, Bmal1)
  - Papers often use protein names or common names instead of official symbols
  - Search the exact name from the paper - synonym matching will find it

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add mouse gene-specific search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting MGI Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add mouse gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
