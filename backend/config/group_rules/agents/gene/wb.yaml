  ## WormBase Gene Search Strategy (Caenorhabditis elegans)

  ### General Guidelines

  - C. elegans gene names follow pattern: 3- to 4-letter prefix + hyphen + number (e.g., unc-4, lin-12, egl-30)
  - Gene symbols are lowercase and italicized
  - Search using the gene name as written in the paper

  ### Interpreting WormBase Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add worm gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
