  ## RGD Gene Search Strategy (Rattus norvegicus)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Rat gene symbols follow similar conventions to mouse (initial cap)
  - Many genes have same symbol as mouse ortholog
  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add rat gene-specific search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting RGD Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add rat gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
