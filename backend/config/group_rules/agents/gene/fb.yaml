  ## FlyBase Gene Search Strategy (Drosophila melanogaster)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Fly gene names can be descriptive (e.g., white, notch, hedgehog)
  - Gene symbols are typically lowercase and italicized
  - Search using the gene name as written in the paper

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  This is a placeholder file. Add fly gene-specific search strategies here.

  ### Interpreting FlyBase Gene Search Results

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query
  - Verify the gene matches what's described in the paper

  This is a placeholder. Add fly gene-specific interpretation guidelines as needed.
