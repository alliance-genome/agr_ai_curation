  ## WormBase PDF Extraction Strategy (Caenorhabditis elegans)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Worm papers use gene-number notation (e.g., unc-4, lin-12)
  - Allele names typically contain mutation codes (e.g., e1315)
  - CGC (Caenorhabditis Genetics Center) strain names are common

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed
