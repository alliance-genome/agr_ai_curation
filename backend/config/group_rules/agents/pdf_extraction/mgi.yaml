  ## MGI PDF Extraction Strategy (Mus musculus)

  ### General Guidelines

  - Mouse papers often describe genotypes using notation like fl/fl, -/-, +/-
  - Tissue-specific knockout prefixes (cs, ns) indicate where deletion occurs
  - Look for Materials & Methods section for strain/genotype details

  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed
