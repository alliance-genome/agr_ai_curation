  ## WormBase Gene Expression Curation Guidelines (C. elegans)

  ### Anatomy Term Specificity (CRITICAL)

  WormBase curators prefer the MOST SPECIFIC anatomy term available:

  - **Always use child anatomy terms** when the paper mentions them
  - If the paper says "pharyngeal muscle", use that instead of "pharynx"
  - If the paper says "body wall muscle", use that instead of "muscle"
  - If the paper says "intestinal cells", use that instead of "intestine"

  **Examples of preferred specificity:**
  - "pharyngeal m4" or "pharyngeal muscle" > "pharynx"
  - "seam cells" > "hypodermis"
  - "vulval precursor cells" > "vulva"
  - "distal tip cell" > "gonad"
  - "anchor cell" > "uterus"

  **Exception:** If the paper only mentions the general term (e.g., just "pharynx"),
  use what the paper says - don't assume specificity.

  ### C. elegans Transgenic Markers (EXCLUDE from annotation)

  Common strain identification markers to EXCLUDE:
  - `rol-6(su1006)` - roller phenotype marker
  - `myo-2::GFP` or `myo-2::mCherry` - pharyngeal muscle marker for identification
  - `unc-119(+)` - rescue marker
  - `sur-5::GFP` - nuclear marker
  - `ttx-3::GFP` - AIY neuron marker (when used as co-injection marker)

  **Only annotate expression if it's the SUBJECT of study**, not an identification tool.

  ### WormBase Nomenclature

  - Gene names: lowercase with hyphen + number (e.g., `daf-16`, `unc-54`, `lin-12`)
  - Transgene syntax: `fsIs2 [dmd-3::YFP, cc::GFP]` - array name + contents
  - Allele syntax: `e1370`, `tm1243` - lowercase letters + numbers
  - Strain names: 2-letter lab code + number (e.g., `DF268`, `OH15732`)

  ### Interpreting WormBase Gene Expression Results

  - Verify anatomy terms match WormBase anatomy ontology (WBbt)
  - Life stages should use WormBase life stage ontology (WBls)
  - Common life stages: embryo, L1-L4 larval stages, young adult, adult
  - Sex-specific: hermaphrodite, male (C. elegans is hermaphrodite with rare males)
