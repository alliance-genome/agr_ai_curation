# Feature Specification: PDF Document Q&A Chat Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-pdf-document-q`
**Created**: 2025-01-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "PDF document Q&A chat interface for biocuration - Users can upload PDF scientific papers and ask natural language questions about the content. The system provides streaming text responses based on the PDF content, maintaining conversation context across multiple questions. Initial scope is pure streaming chat without structured extraction. Users should see responses appear word-by-word as they're generated. The chat should understand the full document context when answering questions about specific sections, findings, or relationships within the paper. Conversation history persists within a session to allow follow-up questions that reference previous Q&A exchanges."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors (biocurators), actions (upload PDFs, ask questions), data (PDFs, chat history), constraints (streaming, session-based)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a biocurator reviewing scientific papers, I need to upload PDF documents and ask natural language questions about their content so that I can quickly understand key findings, methodologies, and relationships within the paper without manually searching through the entire document. The system should provide context-aware answers that appear progressively as they're generated, allowing me to see partial responses immediately.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a biocurator has uploaded a PDF scientific paper, **When** they ask "What genes are mentioned in this paper?", **Then** the system provides a streaming text response listing the genes found in the document
2. **Given** a conversation is in progress about a PDF, **When** the user asks a follow-up question like "Which of those genes are related to disease X?", **Then** the system understands the context from previous Q&A and provides relevant answers
3. **Given** a user is waiting for an answer, **When** the system is generating a response, **Then** the text appears word-by-word as it's being generated rather than all at once
4. **Given** a user has multiple questions about a document, **When** they ask questions in sequence, **Then** the conversation history is maintained within the session for contextual understanding

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the uploaded file is not a valid PDF? System displays an error message notifying the user that the file format is invalid
- How does system handle PDFs that are image-based without text extraction? System displays a warning message notifying the user that the PDF appears to be image-based and may not be readable
- What is the maximum PDF file size allowed? 100MB maximum file size is enforced
- How long does a session persist? Sessions persist through page reloads when possible, with a manual "Start New Session" button available in the chat window
- Can users upload multiple PDFs in one session? Only one document per session is supported; uploading a new document resets the session
- What happens if the PDF contains sensitive/protected content? System displays an error message notifying the user that the content is protected

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload PDF scientific papers
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept natural language questions about uploaded PDF content
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide text responses based on the content of the uploaded PDF
- **FR-004**: System MUST stream responses word-by-word as they are generated
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain conversation context within a session to enable follow-up questions
- **FR-006**: System MUST understand the full document context when answering questions about specific sections, findings, or relationships
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist conversation history within a user session
- **FR-008**: System MUST support structured extraction of tables, figures, and other document elements for enhanced Q&A capabilities
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle PDF files up to 100MB in size
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide responses without specific time constraints (best effort streaming)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support at least 12 concurrent users/sessions
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain the last 10 sessions per user (configurable by user preference)
- **FR-013**: System MUST display error messages when invalid PDF files are uploaded
- **FR-014**: System MUST display warning messages for image-based PDFs without extractable text
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide a "Start New Session" button in the chat interface
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain session persistence through page reloads when possible
- **FR-017**: Uploading a new PDF document MUST reset the current session
- **FR-018**: System MUST display error messages when protected/sensitive PDF content is detected

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **PDF Document**: Represents an uploaded scientific paper with its full text content and metadata (title, authors, publication date if extractable)
- **Question**: A natural language query submitted by the user about the PDF content
- **Response**: An answer generated based on the PDF content, delivered as streaming text
- **Conversation Session**: A collection of question-response pairs maintaining context for a single user's interaction with a specific PDF
- **User Session**: The active period during which a user interacts with the system, containing conversation history
