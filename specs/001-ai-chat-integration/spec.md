# Feature Specification: AI Chat Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-chat-integration`  
**Created**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop AI Chat Integration, a single focused feature that replaces the current stub chat responses with real AI conversation capability in the existing biological paper curation platform."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users of curation platform
   ‚Üí Actions: Ask questions, receive AI responses, select AI models
   ‚Üí Data: Chat messages, conversation history, AI responses
   ‚Üí Constraints: Keep existing architecture, no new database tables
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities - feature scope is well-defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear user flow identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Chat messages and AI responses identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A user working with biological papers in the curation platform opens the chat interface to ask questions about their work. Instead of receiving placeholder responses, they get intelligent, contextual AI assistance that helps them with curation tasks, questions about papers, or general guidance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has the chat interface open, **When** they type "Hello" and send the message, **Then** they receive an intelligent AI response instead of a stub message
2. **Given** a user is asking a question about biological curation, **When** they send their question, **Then** the AI response appears character-by-character in real-time (streaming)
3. **Given** multiple AI models are available, **When** the user selects a different model from the dropdown, **Then** subsequent responses use the selected model
4. **Given** a user is waiting for an AI response, **When** the AI is processing their request, **Then** they see a visual indicator (spinner or typing indicator)
5. **Given** a conversation has occurred, **When** the user refreshes the page or returns later, **Then** their conversation history is preserved and displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when AI service is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does system handle very long user messages or AI responses?
- What occurs if user switches models mid-conversation?
- How does system behave with rapid successive messages?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST replace stub chat responses with actual AI-generated responses
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time streaming display of AI responses as they are generated
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select between different AI providers (OpenAI and Gemini)
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to choose specific AI models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display visual feedback when AI is generating a response
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve existing conversation history functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain all current chat interface components and styling
- **FR-008**: System MUST store AI responses in the existing database structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle AI service errors gracefully without breaking the chat interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST work within the existing Docker development environment

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Chat Message**: User input text, timestamp, session identifier - represents user's question or statement
- **AI Response**: Generated response text, model used, timestamp, streaming status - represents AI's reply to user input
- **AI Configuration**: Selected provider, model choice, API credentials - represents user's AI preferences
- **Chat Session**: Collection of related messages and responses, user context - maintains conversation continuity
