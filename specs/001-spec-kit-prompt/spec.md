## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a biomedical researcher analyzing scientific papers, I need an intelligent assistant that provides real-time conversational responses about biological content while simultaneously extracting and organizing structured data for curation databases, so that I can efficiently understand papers and populate research forms without switching between different tools or waiting for complete analysis.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a researcher has loaded a scientific paper, **When** they ask "What is the function of gene BRCA1 in this paper?", **Then** the system begins displaying response text within 1 second AND identifies BRCA1 as a gene entity for structured extraction

2. **Given** a researcher requests "Fill in the gene curation form for this paper", **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it provides progressive narrative explanation of findings while simultaneously populating form fields with extracted gene data

3. **Given** a researcher asks "Analyze all gene interactions in this study", **When** the system analyzes the paper, **Then** it streams a comprehensive narrative analysis while extracting and categorizing all gene-gene relationships in structured format

4. **Given** a researcher is mid-conversation about protein functions, **When** they interrupt with a new question about disease associations, **Then** the system gracefully handles the topic switch and begins responding to the new query immediately

5. **Given** the system is extracting biological entities, **When** it encounters ambiguous or unclear entity mentions, **Then** it indicates the uncertainty level in both the conversational response and structured data fields

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a paper contains no identifiable biological entities?
- How does system handle contradictory information about the same entity within a paper?
- What occurs when user asks about entities not present in the current paper?
- How does the system respond when interrupted mid-analysis?
- What happens with papers in languages other than English?
- How does system handle scanned PDFs with poor OCR quality?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Conversational Interaction Requirements:**

- **FR-001**: System MUST begin displaying response text within 1 second of receiving a user query
- **FR-002**: System MUST support natural language dialogue about genes, proteins, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals, pathways, organisms, cell types, and anatomical structures
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide flowing, progressive responses that appear as they are generated rather than after complete processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST explain biological findings and provide scientific context in real-time during analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle interruptions and topic changes gracefully without losing conversation context
- **FR-006**: System MUST work with partial information and clearly communicate when additional analysis is being performed

**Structured Data Extraction Requirements:**

- **FR-007**: System MUST extract biological entities with >90% accuracy for well-formed scientific text
- **FR-008**: System MUST categorize extracted entities into predefined types (genes, proteins, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals, pathways, organisms, cell types, anatomical structures)
- **FR-009**: System MUST populate research forms and curation templates automatically with 95% accuracy for standard fields
- **FR-010**: System MUST suggest important passages for highlighting and annotation based on relevance to current curation task
- **FR-011**: System MUST organize findings into structured categories suitable for database entry
- **FR-012**: System MUST perform entity extraction simultaneously with conversational responses without blocking either function

**Paper Analysis Requirements:**

- **FR-013**: System MUST analyze scientific papers in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which file formats - PDF, HTML, DOCX, plain text?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST retain analysis context throughout a research session
- **FR-015**: System MUST identify relationships between biological entities mentioned in papers
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle papers of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what size limits - number of pages, file size in MB?]

**Performance Requirements:**

- **FR-017**: System MUST achieve initial response time of under 1 second for conversational queries
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain >90% accuracy for biological entity extraction
- **FR-019**: System MUST achieve 95% accuracy for correct form field population
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many concurrent users/sessions?]

**Data Management Requirements:**

- **FR-021**: System MUST preserve extracted data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
- **FR-022**: System MUST allow export of structured data in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which formats - JSON, CSV, database formats?]
- **FR-023**: System MUST maintain conversation history for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: duration and storage requirements?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Scientific Paper**: The source document being analyzed, containing biological research information, figures, tables, and references
- **Biological Entity**: A discrete biological concept extracted from papers, classified by type (gene, protein, disease, etc.) with associated metadata
- **Conversation Session**: An ongoing dialogue between researcher and system about one or more papers, maintaining context and history
- **Curation Form**: A structured template for organizing extracted biological information, with predefined fields for different entity types
- **Annotation**: A highlighted passage or note attached to specific text in the paper, linked to extracted entities
- **Gene Interaction**: A relationship between two or more genes described in the paper, including interaction type and evidence
- **Research Finding**: A key conclusion or result from the paper, linked to relevant biological entities and supporting text
