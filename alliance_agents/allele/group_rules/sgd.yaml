  ## SGD-SPECIFIC RULES (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)


  ## SGD Allele Search Strategy (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)


  ### General Guidelines


  - Yeast gene names are typically 3-letter codes in uppercase (e.g., GAL4, TRP1)

  - Deletion alleles are denoted with delta symbol or ::marker notation

  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query

  - Verify the allele type matches what''s described in the paper
