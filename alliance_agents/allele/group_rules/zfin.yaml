  ## ZFIN-SPECIFIC RULES (Danio rerio)


  ## ZFIN Allele Search Strategy (Danio rerio)


  ### General Guidelines


  - Zebrafish gene symbols are typically lowercase (e.g., tp53, brca2)

  - Mutant allele names include lab designation codes

  - Search using the symbol as written in the paper


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed
