  ## WB-SPECIFIC RULES (Caenorhabditis elegans)


  ## WormBase Allele Search Strategy (Caenorhabditis elegans)


  ### General Guidelines


  - C. elegans gene names are typically lowercase and italicized (e.g., unc-4)

  - Allele names follow the pattern: mutation-type + number (e.g., e1315)

  - Search using the allele designation as written in the paper


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  ### Interpreting WB Results:

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query

  - Verify the allele type matches what''s described in the paper
