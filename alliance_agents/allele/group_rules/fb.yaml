  ## FB-SPECIFIC RULES (Drosophila melanogaster)


  ## FlyBase Allele Search Strategy (Drosophila melanogaster)


  ### General Guidelines

  - Search using the symbol as written in the paper

  - Common allele types include: null, hypomorphic, gain-of-function


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed
