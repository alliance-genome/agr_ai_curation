  ## MGI-SPECIFIC RULES (Mus musculus)


  ## MGI Gene Search Strategy (Mus musculus)


  ### General Guidelines


  - Mouse gene symbols use initial capital letter (e.g., Trp53, Bmal1)

  - Papers often use protein names or common names instead of official symbols

  - Search the exact name from the paper - synonym matching will find it


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query

  - Verify the gene matches what''s described in the paper
