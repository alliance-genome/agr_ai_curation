  ## SGD-SPECIFIC RULES (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)


  ## SGD Gene Search Strategy (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)


  ### General Guidelines


  - Yeast gene names are typically 3-letter codes in uppercase (e.g., GAL4, TRP1)

  - Standard names may differ from systematic names (YBR155W)

  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed


  This is a placeholder file. Add yeast gene-specific search strategies here.



  ### Interpreting SGD Results:

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query

  - Verify the gene matches what''s described in the paper
