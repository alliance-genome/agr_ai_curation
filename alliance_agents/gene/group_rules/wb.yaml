  ## WB-SPECIFIC RULES (Caenorhabditis elegans)


  ## WormBase Gene Search Strategy (Caenorhabditis elegans)


  ### General Guidelines


  - C. elegans gene names follow pattern: 3- to 4-letter prefix + hyphen + number (e.g., unc-4, lin-12)

  - Gene symbols are lowercase and italicized

  - Search using the gene name as written in the paper


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query

  - Verify the gene matches what''s described in the paper
