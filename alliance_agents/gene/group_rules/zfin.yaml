  ## ZFIN-SPECIFIC RULES (Danio rerio)


  ## ZFIN Gene Search Strategy (Danio rerio)


  ### General Guidelines


  - Zebrafish gene symbols are lowercase (e.g., tp53, brca2)

  - Human orthologs use lowercase version of human symbol

  - Search using the gene symbol as written in the paper


  ### Placeholder - Expand as Needed

  - Check the `matched_on` field to see what text matched your query

  - Verify the gene matches what''s described in the paper
